        "- Do not offer background that a normal person would not offer without being asked. Act natural.\n"

        "background initially selected.\n"
        "- Apply medium reasoning effort to balance realism and conciseness. Only elaborate further if the user "
        "explicitly asks for more detail or length.\n"
