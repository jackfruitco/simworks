# simcore_ai_django/services/decorators.py
"""Django-aware LLM service decorator.

This module composes the Django identity/tokens mixins with the **core**
service registration decorator to provide a drop-in `@llm_service` that:

- Supports decorating **classes and async functions** (function targets are
  wrapped into a `BaseLLMService` subclass by the core decorator).
- Resolves identity using Django-aware defaults (AppConfig-aware) while
  preserving the core precedence rules:
    kwargs > class attrs > Django/module defaults
- Strips affix tokens from the **name only** (case-insensitive, both ends,
  iterative) using merged sources (core defaults + env + Django settings +
  AppConfig contributions).
- Registers services with the core `ServiceRegistry` and enforces tupleÂ³
  uniqueness. Collisions are handled by the decorator via hyphen-int suffixing
  on the **name** (`name-2`, `-3`, ...), with WARNING logs; import-time never
  crashes.

No Django imports are required here beyond the mixins module, which is designed
to be import-safe even when Django settings/apps are not initialized yet.
